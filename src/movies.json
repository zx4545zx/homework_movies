Since nodding to Edward's proposal, she has been pushed beyond limits by unaffordable housing, archaic customs, and intrusive in-laws. What befuddles her further is the reappearance of Shuwei, a mainlander she's supposed to be divorced from out of a sham marriage that solved her coming-of-age hardship. Zeroing in on nuts and bolts of modern marriage, My Prince Edward pokes around fixated correlations of freedom with relationship status and geographic residence. Like a breath of fresh air out of the breathless space it navigates, the whimsical gem contributes a rare humane take on the worldly metropolis's divisions with humor and wisdom. As Fong redefines her best life and writer-director Norris Wong reclaims her home city's narrative from outsiders in this debut, their courage sparks thrills and will make you wholeheartedly cheer for a woman's independence and a new age in Hong Kong cinema.",

Quinn Donahue is an old-school bohemian spirit who struggles in this new world of responsibility and ethics. The drama all takes place under the shadow of their friend Austin Gamby, who made it big right out of art school. They quickly learn that the life of an artist today isn't the romantic idea they believed it to be, but they must deal with it if they ever want to be successful. Veteran indie filmmaker Michael Walker takes us on a darkly comedic journey into the underbelly of the art world where friendships are tested and romances may not be what they seem.",

In his magical realism inspired world, James goes on a whimsical, but emotionally charged search to solve the mystery of the disappearance of his sister, after an altercation with their parents depicted by Lisa Edelstein (Girlfriends' Guide to Divorce, The Kominsky Method), and Jason Isaacs (Harry Potter, Star Trek: Discovery). While James (Zumann) struggles to connect with his parents, he deals with the intense social anxiety of high school life while navigating first love with Sophie, portrayed by Taylor Russell (Lost in Space, Waves) -- a precocious girl from school who has her own agenda and a boyfriend Martin that hasn't quite learned to let go of her, brought to life by Chase Stokes (Outer Banks). Our two lovestruck teens set out on a quest to find Jorie, finding themselves in what appears to be a cult of sorts, led by David Arquette (Scream series) as Xavier, and into the under belly of NYC nightlife that makes James question every relationship in his life.",

In a psychotic blackout, Elyse commits vehicular manslaughter of her son and his nanny, Julia. Elyse isn't the only victim; her delusional thinking, narcissism, and violence annihilate her husband. Memory and hallucination intertwine to expose a history of trauma, revealing the truth: Elyse is Catatonic and institutionalized in a State Hospital. Elyse's recovery is reliant on the dissolution of her marriage, the restoration of the relationship with her mother, and the mutual absolution with the nanny's daughter, Carmen. It's the care from Dr. Lewis (Anthony Hopkins) and the unconditional love from her nurse, David, that promise Elyse a new life.",
